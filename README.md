WP Developers | Liberty Alliance Radio Popup
===

Hello there! I'm an awesome plugin that creates an shortcode that opens a Liberty Alliance Radio player. I include some code that also allows shortcodes in the default text widgets, so you don't have to worry about that. You can easily place the player popup button by using the shortcode [laradio]. ---------------

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. Place the shortcode in a theme file, widget, post, etc.
